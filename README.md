## Project Overview
This project analyzes over 1.3 million LinkedIn job postings from 2024 to build a data-driven job recommendation system.  
Using natural language processing and structured feature engineering, we extract skills, job titles, and locations to identify meaningful relationships between roles.  
The final model recommends relevant job opportunities based on similarity in required skills and job descriptions.
